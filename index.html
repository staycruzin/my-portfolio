               <h2>About</h2>
               <p>I am a full-stack software developer based in San Diego, California who focuses on writing clean, elegant, and efficient code. 
                    I love to code things from scratch and to watch my ideas come to life in the browser.
               </p> 
               <p>When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me somewhere enjoying the great outdoors. I've learned many valuable life lessons in the mountains, 
                    and these values — from breaking out of my comfort zone to taking one step at a time — translate from the trail to the workplace. I am 
                    constantly seeking out new ways to push the boundaries of my comfort zone and I perceive challenges as an opportunity to learn and grow. 
                    Additionally, I have learned to embrace the journey and focus on taking one step at a time so that I can put myself in the best position to 
                    achieve goals and deliver consistently through proper planning and by breaking down projects into smaller, manageable parts.
               </p>
               <p>I am passionate about building software that is making a difference in the world and I'm looking to make a big impact at a high growth company w
                    here I can work on interesting projects with positive people. Let's make something special.
